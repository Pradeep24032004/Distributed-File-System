# Distributed-File-System

## Overview
This project simulates a Distributed File System where files are stored and managed across multiple "nodes" (storage locations). It includes features like file uploads, node failure simulation, file reallocation, and dynamic addition/removal of nodes.
## Major Functionalities
1.File Upload and Replication:
     A file is uploaded to the system via an API endpoint.
     The file is initially stored on the first node and replicated across all other nodes to ensure redundancy.
